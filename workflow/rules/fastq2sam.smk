## The raw data format (e.g., FASTQ or BAM) and existing processing pipelines
## determine the optimal method to generate a mapped BAM file that contains UMI
## information. Ultimately, you should extract the in-line UMI sequence from each
## read and store it in the RX tag in an unmapped BAM file. Read 1 and read 2 of the
## same pair should have the same value stored in the RX tag, regardless of which
## read contains the UMI sequence.

## If raw data are in FASTQ files instead of unmapped BAM files, use Picardâ€™s
## FastqToSam tool to convert the FASTQ files into unmapped BAM files.
